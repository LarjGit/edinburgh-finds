# Edinburgh Finds Lens Configuration
# Sports and Fitness Vertical for Edinburgh
#
# This lens defines how the universal entity engine is interpreted for the sports/fitness domain.
# All vertical-specific concepts, taxonomy, and domain behavior live here.
#
# KEY RULES:
# - All dimension_source MUST be one of: canonical_activities, canonical_roles, canonical_place_types, canonical_access
# - Every value.facet MUST reference a facet defined in facets section
# - Role facet is internal-only (not shown in UI)
# - Role keys are universal function-style (provides_facility, sells_goods, provides_instruction, membership_org)
# - Role display_name carries vertical/product terminology (Venue, Retailer, Coach/Instructor, Club)
# - private_club moved from place_type to access facet
# - place_type represents container classification (sports_centre, park, gym_facility), NOT individual facilities
# - Individual facilities (courts, pitches, pools, tracks) belong in domain modules (sports_facility.inventory)

# Facets
# Maps lens-level facets to actual database columns (dimensions)
# NOTE on naming:
#   - facet key (activity, role, place_type, access) is the lens-level concept used in module_triggers
#   - dimension_source (canonical_activities, etc.) is the actual DB column name
#   - This distinction avoids key collisions and enables triggers across all facets
