# PRD (summary for AI context)

## 1. Core Mission & USP

Mission: To build the premier hyper-local, niche-focused discovery platform, starting with Padel in Edinburgh.

USP: "AI-Scale, Local Soul" — Using LLMs to autonomously source, ingest, and structure data at scale, while delivering a "locally curated" UX that feels like advice from a knowledgeable friend.

## 2. The Universal Entity Framework (Architecture)

The system must be architected to support **any** niche via a generic, scalable structure:

- **Verticals:** (e.g., Padel, Golf, Climbing).
    
- **Entity Pillars:** 1. Infrastructure (Venues), 2. Commerce (Retail), 3. Guidance (Coaches), 4. Organization (Clubs), 5. Momentum (Events).
    
- **Generic Attributes:** Every entity uses flexible attributes (e.g., "Indoor/Outdoor," "Equipment Hire") to allow horizontal scaling without code changes.
    

## 3. The Target Audience

- **Enthusiasts:** Beginners (where to start?), Active players (how to improve?), and Problem-Solvers (where is available?).
    
- **Business Owners:** Seeking high-intent leads and visibility. The platform is a **marketing channel**, not a booking engine.
    

## 4. Content & Quality Standards

- **Voice:** "The Knowledgeable Local Friend." Content must include geographic context (neighborhoods) and practical quirks (e.g., "it gets windy here").
    
- **Forbidden:** Marketing fluff, vague superlatives, and generic AI-sounding summaries.
    
- **Trust Architecture:** Tiered confidence system. **Business-claimed data** is the gold standard. We prioritize _credibility over completeness_.
    

## 5. Growth & Monetization Logic

- **Phase 1 (Growth):** Free listings, SEO-first (Programmatic Long-Tail), and community trust.
    
- **Phase 2 (Revenue):** Transition to a Freemium model (Premium listings, analytics, and featured placement).
    
- **Non-Goals:** No payment processing or real-time booking integrations for the MVP.
