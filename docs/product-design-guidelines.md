# Product Design Guidelines

## 1. Design Philosophy: "The Sophisticated Canvas"

- **Agnostic Elegance:** Design must be a "clean gallery" style. Avoid industry tropes (e.g., no "neon green" for Padel). Use a premium, neutral aesthetic that works for everything from Sports to Fine Arts.
    
- **Slick Interaction:** Prioritize high-end typography, intentional whitespace, and subtle micro-interactions (hover states, smooth transitions) to signal "quality."
    
- **Structured Beauty:** Transform raw entity data (opening hours, court specs) into visual components (tags, icons, progress bars) rather than text blocks.
    

## 2. Tone of Voice: "The Local Artisan"

- **The Persona:** A "Knowledgeable Local Friend" who is helpful, warm, and authoritative.
    
- **The "Magic Trick" (Humanizing AI):** AI does the heavy lifting, but the output must read like it was hand-curated.
    
    - **Prohibited:** "Located at," "Features include," "A great place for."
        
    - **Required:** Contextual bridges like "Just a short walk from [Landmark]" or "Perfect for those who prefer [Specific Need]."
        
- **Utility Over Hype:** Never use marketing fluff. If a venue is expensive, call it "Premium-priced." If it's basic, call it "Functional and focused."
    

## 3. UX Principles: "Frictionless Discovery"

- **Mobile-First Utility:** Mobile view is a "tool" (prioritize 'Directions' and 'Call' buttons); Desktop view is a "resource" (prioritize 'Comparison' and 'Deep Research').
    
- **The "Two-Click" Rule:** A user should be able to pivot from one entity type to another (e.g., _Venue_ to _Coach_) in no more than two clicks.
    
- **Progressive Disclosure:** * **Level 1 (The Card):** Vital stats only (Name, Image, Hero Tag, Rating).
    
    - **Level 2 (The Profile):** Detailed attributes, AI-summary, and map.
        
    - **Level 3 (The Deep Dive):** Full pricing tables, schedules, and long-form reviews.
        

## 4. Technical Quality Standards

- **SEO Hygiene:** Every page must have a unique, human-readable meta-description and a logical H-tag hierarchy.
    
- **Data Freshness UI:** Always display a "Last Verified" date or "Confidence Score" on listings to manage user expectations and build trust.
