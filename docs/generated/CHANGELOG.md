## 2026-02-06 — Initial Comprehensive Documentation Generation

### Documents Created

All documentation was auto-generated from codebase analysis:

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | System architecture overview, component diagram, tech stack, data flow |
| [DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) | Database schema, ERD diagram, model descriptions, indexing strategy |
| [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) | Feature inventory with technical details and implementation status |
| [ONBOARDING.md](ONBOARDING.md) | Complete setup guide from clone to running |
| [API.md](API.md) | CLI commands, Prisma query patterns, internal Python APIs |
| [FRONTEND.md](FRONTEND.md) | Next.js app structure, components, state management, styling |
| [BACKEND.md](BACKEND.md) | Python engine modules, interfaces, CLI entry points |
| [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) | CI/CD pipeline, environment config, deployment architecture |
| [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) | Development workflow, coding standards, testing strategy |
| [CONFIGURATION.md](CONFIGURATION.md) | Environment variables, YAML configs, third-party service setup |
| [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) | This file — documents generation history |

### Source Material

Documentation was generated by analyzing:

- **Authoritative docs:** `docs/system-vision.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/development-methodology.md`
- **Engine code:** 90+ Python files across ingestion, extraction, orchestration, lenses, and schema modules
- **Frontend code:** Next.js App Router pages, Prisma client, utility libraries
- **Configuration:** YAML schemas, connector configs, CI/CD workflows
- **Test suite:** 60+ test files covering purity, extraction, orchestration, lens validation
- **Database schema:** Auto-generated Prisma schema from YAML source of truth

### Important Notes

1. **These docs are generated overviews.** The authoritative architectural documents remain:
   - `docs/system-vision.md` — Immutable invariants (never changes)
   - `docs/architecture.md` — Runtime specification (evolves deliberately)

2. **Keep docs in sync.** When the codebase changes significantly, regenerate these docs or update manually.

3. **Sensitive data was not included.** API keys in `sources.yaml` are gitignored. The documentation references placeholder values.

## Areas Needing Manual Review

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** — Verify Mermaid diagrams render correctly in your viewer
- **FRONTEND.md** — The frontend is minimal; update as pages/components are added
- **API.md** — No REST API exists yet; update when one is created
- **DEPLOYMENT.md** — Production deployment not yet configured; update when deploying
- **ONBOARDING.md** — Test the setup steps on a fresh machine

---

## Keeping Documentation Updated

**When to update:**
- New connector added → Update FEATURES.md, BACKEND.md, CONFIGURATION.md
- New lens created → Update FEATURES.md, CONFIGURATION.md
- Schema changes → Update DATABASE.md
- New pages/components → Update FRONTEND.md
- New CLI commands → Update API.md
- Deployment changes → Update DEPLOYMENT.md
- Environment changes → Update CONFIGURATION.md, ONBOARDING.md
