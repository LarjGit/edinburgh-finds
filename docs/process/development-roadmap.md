**Purpose:** Describe WHAT we are choosing to work toward and WHY.  
**Nature:** This document is strategic and narrative. It does not prescribe how work is executed.

## R-01 — Establish New Governance Structure

### Bootstrap Context

This entry describes a transition that is already in motion.  
The new Development Methodology and Development Roadmap documents exist and are being used as the conceptual framework for completing the refactor they describe. This self-referential situation is intentional and temporary; the goal is to reach a steady state where future roadmap entries describe work not yet begun.

### Intent

Reorganize project documentation so that:

- Development Methodology expresses only how work is executed  
- Development Roadmap expresses only what we choose to pursue  
- Development Catalog becomes a neutral ledger of work and proofs  
- Lessons Learned becomes the home for compounding knowledge

### Why

- The previous methodology mixed decision logic with execution rules, creating confusion.  
- We need freedom to explore new directions without rewriting the methodology.  
- Agents and humans must clearly distinguish strategy from discipline.  
- The catalog should be an evidence record, not a plan.

### Scope Boundaries

**In Scope**

- Introduce a structure that separates:
  - process documents  
  - progress records  
- Create or relocate:
  - development-methodology  
  - development-roadmap  
  - development-catalog (renamed from audit-catalog)  
- Migrate content so that:
  - methodology contains only execution law  
  - roadmap contains only strategic reasoning  
- Update cross-references in existing documentation

**Out of Scope**

- Any change to golden documents  
- Any change to application code behavior  
- Re-auditing existing architectural violations  
- Restructuring the internal content of the catalog

### Success Criteria

- The three roles are clearly separated:
  - Methodology → how  
  - Roadmap → what  
  - Catalog → record  
- The catalog remains intact after rename  
- No operational references to “audit-catalog” remain  
- A reader can understand the governance model without inference

### Proof Signals

Evidence that this direction has succeeded may include:

- All documentation links resolve to their new locations  
- The catalog loads without structural change  
- The methodology reads as pure execution discipline  
- The roadmap reads as pure strategic intent
