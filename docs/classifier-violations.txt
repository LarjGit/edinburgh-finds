Classifier Purity Violations - 2026-01-29
==========================================

Source: engine/extraction/entity_classifier.py

VIOLATIONS FOUND:
-----------------
Line 112: org_types = {"retailer", "shop", "business", "organization", "league", "club", "association"}
  - Domain-specific organization type checks
  - Should use structural signals only

Line 120: if any(term in category_str for term in ["retail", "shop", "business", "league", "chain"]):
  - Category-based domain checking
  - Violates engine purity (Invariant 1)

Line 167: if entity_type in {"retailer", "shop"} or raw_data.get("sells_goods"):
  - Domain-specific type names in extract_roles
  - Should use structural/universal types only

DOCSTRING EXAMPLES (Lines 182-294):
  - Contains "tennis", "padel", "wine" in examples
  - These are acceptable as documentation examples
  - Not actual domain logic violations

REFACTORING PLAN:
-----------------
1. Replace is_organization_like with structural-only rules
   - Use: location_count, employee_count, is_franchise
   - Remove: category-based checks, domain type names

2. Update extract_roles to use universal types only
   - Keep: structural field checks (provides_equipment, etc.)
   - Remove: domain-specific type checks
