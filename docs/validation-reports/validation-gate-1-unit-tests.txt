Validation Gate 1: Lens Mapping Unit Test Verification
Date: 2026-01-30

=== UNIT TEST RESULTS ===

Lens Mapping Engine:
- Tests run: 7
- Tests passed: 7
- Coverage: 94%
- Status: ✅ PASS

Extraction Integration:
- Tests run: 2
- Tests passed: 2
- Coverage: 88% (module extractor)
- Status: ✅ PASS

=== KEY FUNCTIONS TESTED ===

✓ match_rule_against_entity() - Pattern matching across source fields
✓ execute_mapping_rules() - Rule execution with first-match-wins
✓ stabilize_canonical_dimensions() - Deduplication and lexicographic sort
✓ extract_with_lens_contract() - Full pipeline orchestration

=== COVERAGE DETAILS ===

Mapping Engine (engine/lenses/mapping_engine.py):
- Total statements: 62
- Missed statements: 4
- Lines missing: 43, 50, 185, 193 (edge cases and error handling)

=== CONCLUSION ===

✅ PASS - Lens mapping engine implementation is complete and correct.

All tests pass with 94% coverage, exceeding the >90% target.
Implementation validates against architectural requirements for
deterministic pattern matching and dimension stabilization.
