Phase 1 Lens Integration Validation - 2026-01-29
================================================

LENS MAPPING ENGINE: ✅ COMPLETE
---------------------------------
- Mapping engine implemented (engine/lenses/mapping_engine.py)
- Unit tests: 7/7 passing
- Integration tests: 2/2 passing
- Functions: match_rule_against_entity, execute_mapping_rules, stabilize_canonical_dimensions, apply_lens_mapping

LENS STRUCTURE MIGRATION: ✅ COMPLETE
--------------------------------------
- Created unified lens.yaml for edinburgh_finds
- Migrated from old structure (query_vocabulary.yaml + connector_rules.yaml)
- Updated query_lens.py to load from unified lens.yaml
- Changed default lens from "padel" to "edinburgh_finds"

ORCHESTRATION INTEGRATION: ✅ WORKING
-------------------------------------
- Orchestration CLI runs successfully with new lens
- Query: "powerleague portobello edinburgh"
- Results: 11 candidates found, 8 accepted, 3 duplicates removed
- Connectors: serper (10 candidates), google_places (1 candidate)

DATABASE STATUS:
----------------
- Raw ingestions: 211 records ✅
- Extracted entities: 0 records (extraction not run)
- Finalized entities: 0 records (finalization not run)

NOTE: Extraction/finalization pipeline not triggered by orchestration CLI.
This is a separate workflow issue, not a lens mapping issue.

VALIDATION CONCLUSION:
----------------------
✅ Lens mapping engine implementation: COMPLETE
✅ Lens integration: SUCCESSFUL  
✅ Orchestration compatibility: VERIFIED

The lens mapping engine works correctly. End-to-end entity validation
will require running extraction and finalization steps separately.
