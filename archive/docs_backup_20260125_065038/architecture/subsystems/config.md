# Subsystem: config

## Purpose
The `config` subsystem manages the environment variables, test configurations, and reporting data for the Edinburgh Finds project. It provides templates for environment setup and defines rules for the testing framework.

## Key Components
- `.env.example`: A template for environment variables required by the application, including database connections and external API keys.
- `pytest.ini`: Configuration for the `pytest` testing framework, defining custom markers.
- `coverage.json`: A machine-readable coverage report generated by the test suite (note: this is typically an output artifact rather than source configuration).

## Architecture
The configuration is decentralized but follows standard conventions:
- **Environment Variables**: Managed via `.env` files (loaded by the application at runtime).
- **Testing**: `pytest.ini` provides global settings for test execution.

## Dependencies
### Internal
This subsystem is consumed by almost all other subsystems, especially `engine-core`, `engine-extraction`, and `backend`.

### External
- **PostgreSQL**: Configured via `DATABASE_URL`.
- **Anthropic API**: Configured via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for LLM-based extraction.
- **Google Places API**: Configured via `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` for data ingestion.
- **Serper API**: Configured via `SERPER_API_KEY` for search-based ingestion.

## Data Models
Not applicable. This subsystem focuses on key-value pairs and tool-specific configuration formats.

## Configuration
### Environment Variables (from `.env.example`)
| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | API key for Anthropic's Claude models. |
| `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` | API key for Google Places API. |
| `SERPER_API_KEY` | API key for Serper search API. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Application logging verbosity (e.g., INFO, DEBUG). |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment (e.g., development). |
