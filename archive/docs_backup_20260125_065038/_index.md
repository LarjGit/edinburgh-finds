# Edinburgh Finds Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for **Edinburgh Finds**, an intelligent data ingestion and discovery platform for the city of Edinburgh and beyond.

## Overview
Edinburgh Finds is a multi-source data engine designed to discover, ingest, and enrich geographic and entity-based information. It uses a sophisticated orchestration system to combine data from various sources (OpenStreetMap, Google Places, Serper, Edinburgh Council, etc.) into a unified, high-quality dataset.

The system is built with a focus on **Engine Purity**, where schemas are defined in a single source of truth (YAML) and propagated across Python (ETL) and TypeScript (Frontend) layers to ensure consistency and eliminate schema drift.

## Technology Stack

### Core Engine (Python)
- **Orchestration:** Custom multi-phase pipeline for data ingestion.
- **Validation:** Pydantic for schema-driven data integrity.
- **LLM Integration:** Instructor and Anthropic (Claude) for intelligent extraction and synthesis.
- **Database Access:** Prisma Client Python.
- **Utilities:** `phonenumbers`, `fuzzywuzzy` for data normalization and deduplication.

### Web & API (TypeScript)
- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (React 19) with App Router.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 and shadcn/ui.
- **ORM:** Prisma 7.3+ connecting to PostgreSQL.
- **Language:** TypeScript for end-to-end type safety.

### Infrastructure
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (Supabase).
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for testing and validation.
