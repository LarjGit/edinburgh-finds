# Project Configuration & Infrastructure

This section covers the foundational configuration files and infrastructure settings that govern the development environment, testing framework, and repository management.

## Overview

The project uses a variety of tools for environment management, testing, and documentation. The configuration is centralized in the root directory and specialized subdirectories like `.claude`, `.doc-suite`, and `.github`.

## Components

### Environment & Version Control
- **`.env` / `.env.example`**: Manages sensitive environment variables like `DATABASE_URL` and API keys.
- **`.gitignore`**: Defines files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., `node_modules`, `temp/`, `.next/`).
- **`.gitattributes`**: Configures Git-specific file attributes.

### Testing Infrastructure
- **`pytest.ini`**: Configures the Pytest runner, including custom markers like `slow`.
- **`conftest.py`**: A root-level Pytest configuration file that ensures the project root is added to `sys.path` for correct module resolution during tests.
- **`.coverage` / `coverage.json`**: Artifacts generated by the `coverage.py` tool to track test coverage.

### Agent & Tooling Configuration
- **`.claude/settings.local.json`**: Local settings for the Claude agent environment.
- **`.doc-suite/SPEC.md`**: The specification for the `DOC-SUITE` documentation generator, defining its operation, limits, and phases.
- **`.github/pull_request_template.md`**: Provides a standardized template for creating pull requests on GitHub.

### Workspace & Visualization
- **`.obsidian/`**: Configuration for the Obsidian knowledge base, including community plugins like `mermaid-popup`.
- **`mermaid-popup` Plugin**: A local Obsidian plugin for rendering and interacting with Mermaid diagrams.

## Configuration Surface

### Testing
Evidence: `pytest.ini:1-3`
```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')
```

### Environment Variables
Key variables required:
- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string for the PostgreSQL database.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`: Frontend-specific environment variables for the Web application.

## Public Interfaces

### Doc-Suite Commands
Evidence: `.doc-suite/SPEC.md:14-25`
The following commands are supported:
- `DOC-SUITE: FULL [AUTO]`
- `DOC-SUITE: DELTA [AUTO]`
- `DOC-SUITE: STEP`
- `DOC-SUITE: FINALIZE`

## Examples

### Pytest Execution
To run tests excluding slow ones:
```bash
pytest -m "not slow"
```

## Edge Cases / Notes
- **Path Resolution**: The `conftest.py` in the root is critical for ensuring that `engine` and other top-level modules are importable in a consistent manner across different execution environments.
- **Obsidian Integration**: The project includes a dedicated Obsidian configuration, suggesting that documentation and architectural mapping are also intended to be consumed via Obsidian.
