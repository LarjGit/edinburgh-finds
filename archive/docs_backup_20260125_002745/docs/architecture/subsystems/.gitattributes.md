# Subsystem: .gitattributes

## Purpose
This subsystem consists of the `.gitattributes` file, which configures Git attributes for specific paths in the repository. It is primarily used here to mark certain files as generated, preventing them from being counted in language statistics or shown by default in diffs.

## Components
- `.gitattributes`: Configuration file for Git attributes.

## Configuration
The file is configured to treat the following as generated files:
- `engine/schema/listing.py`
- `engine/schema/venue.py`
- Any file matching `engine/schema/*_generated.py`

## Evidence
- Evidence: .gitattributes:1-7 (Content analysis)
