This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Database Setup (Important)

This project uses a local SQLite database (`dev.db`) that is **shared** with the Python Data Engine.

- **Location:** The database file is located at `web/dev.db`.
- **Configuration:** The `.env` file uses `DATABASE_URL="file:../dev.db"`.
    - *Why `../`?* Prisma looks for the database relative to the `schema.prisma` file (in `web/prisma/`), so it needs to go up one level to find `web/dev.db`.
- **Prisma Version:** Pinned to Prisma 5 to ensure reliable SQLite support without complex configuration adapters.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
