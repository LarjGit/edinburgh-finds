# Product Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
- **Niche-Agnostic & Modern:** The design must be a clean, sophisticated canvas that elevates the content. Avoid niche-specific tropes (e.g., no "sporty" grunge textures). The aesthetic should feel premium, trustworthy, and adaptable to any interest category.
- **Slick & Attractive:** Use high-quality typography, generous whitespace, and subtle interactions to create a polished, "slick" feel.
- **Data-Driven Elegance:** Present complex data structures (attributes, schedules, prices) in a way that is digestible and visually appealing, not just a raw table dump.

## Tone of Voice
- **The "Local Expert":** The copy should sound like a knowledgeable local guide—warm, helpful, and authoritative.
- **Curated yet Comprehensive:** Bridge the gap between "hand-picked" and "AI-aggregated." Use language that implies care and selection (e.g., "Discover Edinburgh's Best X") while maintaining the objectivity of a directory.
- **Trustworthy:** Avoid salesy hype. Focus on accuracy and utility.

## User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Responsive Excellence:** The interface must be flawless on both desktop and mobile. Mobile users should have easy access to quick actions (call, map), while desktop users should benefit from expanded views and filtering tools.
- **Intuitive Discovery:** Navigation should be effortless. Users should be able to pivot easily between categories (Padel -> Football) and entity types (Venue -> Coach) without getting lost.
- **Smart Information Hierarchy:** "Progressive Disclosure" is key. Show the most critical info (Name, Rating, Location, Key Tags) upfront, and reveal deeper details (Pricing tables, specific attributes) upon interaction.
