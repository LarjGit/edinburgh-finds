# Initial Concept

It's an online directory that is serving niche, hobbies and interests, which I think are those categories I want to start with a single category, say padel and build additional categories over time. Each category will be will have a variety of entity types for example venue, retailer, club, event coach etc. And each of these entity types will have entities like for example the venue, powerleague Portobello. Users of the online directory will be interested in finding more information about their niche or hobby or interest events that are on venues that host the interest retailers that sell stuff coaches of the interest, anything like that they will be the interested parties. Also, I am expecting owners of the entity types EGE the venues, the coaches, the retailers, the events in the clubs to be interested in the traffic that is coming through my directory and I will try and monetize this somehow through either advertisements or subscriptions from the owners of the businesses
