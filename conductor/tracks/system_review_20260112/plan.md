# Implementation Plan - Comprehensive Architecture & Documentation Review

## Phase 1: Codebase & Schema Analysis
- [x] Task: Generate file system map using `list_directory` (recursive).
- [x] Task: Analyze `engine/schema.prisma` vs `web/prisma/schema.prisma` for consistency.
- [x] Task: Inspect `engine/schema/` python files for alignment with the generic `Listing` model.
- [x] Task: Review `conductor/` documentation against the generated file system map.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Codebase & Schema Analysis' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Report Generation
- [x] Task: Compile findings into `conductor/tracks/system_review_20260112/architecture_report.md`.
    - Section: Schema Analysis (Sync status, Generic Model adoption).
    - Section: Documentation Gaps (Docs -> Code and Code -> Docs).
    - Section: Architectural Health (Dependencies, Structure).
- [x] Task: Create `conductor/tracks/system_review_20260112/discrepancy_log.md`.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Report Generation' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Remediation Planning
- [ ] Task: Create a new `plan.md` (or update this one) with specific fix tasks based on findings.
- [ ] Task: Present "Actionable Plan" to user for approval.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Remediation Planning' (Protocol in workflow.md)
