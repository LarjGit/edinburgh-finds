# Implementation Plan - Conductor Documentation Synchronization

## Phase 1: Tech Stack Synchronization
- [x] Task: Analyze `web/package.json` and `engine/requirements.txt` to identify version and dependency discrepancies.
- [x] Task: Update `conductor/tech-stack.md` to reflect current versions (e.g., Prisma 7.3, Next.js 16) and actual libraries in use.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Tech Stack Synchronization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 2: Product & Architecture Alignment
- [ ] Task: Review `conductor/product.md` against the current project directory structure and `ARCHITECTURE.md` to identify drift.
- [ ] Task: Update `conductor/product.md` to match the actual file organization, "Universal Entity Framework" implementation, and current folder hierarchy.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Product & Architecture Alignment' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Workflow & Guidelines Validation
- [ ] Task: Verify development commands in `conductor/workflow.md` against `package.json` scripts, `pytest` configuration, and actual usage.
- [ ] Task: Update `conductor/workflow.md` with correct, executable commands and ensure workflow protocols match the current process.
- [ ] Task: Review `conductor/product-guidelines.md` and update to ensure design and quality guidelines align with existing implementation patterns.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Workflow & Guidelines Validation' (Protocol in workflow.md)
